# VIGALL
VIGALL is an AddIn for BrainVision Analyzer 2.0 that automates EEG vigilance analysis. This C# project compiles a DLL that needs to be put into the Analyzer directory so BrainVision Analyzer 2.0 can find it and offer it in its AddIn menu. It uses the .NET Framework version 2. The project web site is https://research.uni-leipzig.de/vigall/ .

VIGALL was developed at the Department of Psychiatry of Leipzig University (http://psychiatrie.uniklinikum-leipzig.de/) with support of the Leipzig Research Center for Civilisation Diseases (http://life.uni-leipzig.de/). The latest Version (VIGALL 2.1) was developed and validated at the Research Centre of the German Depression Foundation (https://www.deutsche-depressionshilfe.de/).
## Getting Started
This was built in Microsoft Visual Studio so it might be easiest to use that. Set up the project to produce a DLL for the Analyzer executable.
## Contributing
This project is mostly here in order to allow forks and to archive it publically. If you want to collaborate on future versions rather than simply take the code and do with it what you want, please contact the German Depression Foundation with your ideas.
